2.
In most type of liver disease, ALT activity is higher than that of AST; exception may be seen in Alcoholic 
Hepatitis, Hepatic Cirrhosis, and Liver neoplasia. In a patient with Chronic liver disease, AST:ALT 
ratio>1 is highly suggestive of advanced liver fibrosis.
3.
In known cases of Chronic Liver disease due to Viral Hepatitis B & C, Alcoholic liver disease or NAFLD,  
Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test may be used  to evaluate liver fibrosis.
4.
In a patient with Chronic Liver disease,  AFP and Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP)/PIVKA II can 
be used to assess risk for development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
