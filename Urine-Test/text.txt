Urinalysis Sample Report 
Different laboratories generate reports that can vary greatly in appearance and in the order and kind of 
information included. This is one example of what a lab report for a urinalysis may look like. Names and 
places used have been made up for illustrative purposes only. Point your cursor at a number to learn

** END OF REPORT ** 
EXAMPLE ONLY
1.	 Name and address of the lab where the test was performed. 
Tests may be run in a physician office lab, a lab located in a 
clinic or hospital, and/or samples may be sent to a reference 
laboratory for analysis.
2.	 Date this copy of the report was printed. This date may be 
different than the date the results were generated, especially 
on cumulative reports (those that include results of several 
different tests run on different days).
3.	 Patient name or identifier. Links results to the correct person.
4.	 Patient identifier and identification number. Links results to the 
correct person.
5.	 Name of doctor. The lab will send the results to the doctor(s) 
listed.
6.	 Status of the test request, such as Routine or STAT (perform 
test as rapidly as possible).
7.	 Unique identification number(s). Number(s) assigned to the 
sample(s) when it arrives at the laborato-ry.
8.	 Test being requested is a visual and chemical examination of 
the urine. If there are any abnormal findings then a microscopic 
evaluation of the urine (IF IND, UA MICRO) will also be 
performed.
9.	 Information about the person and urine sample, and a request 
for added Urine Culture and Suscep-tibility (C&S) testing if 
urinalysis results indicate that the person appears to have an 
infection.
10.	The date and time of sample collection
11.	The date and time that the laboratory received the sample.
12.	A listing of the aspects of the urine that are being evaluated.
13.	A listing of the urinalysis results that are normal.
14.	A listing of the urinalysis results that are abnormal.
15.	An ‘H’ in this column may mean that the result is higher than 
the reference range. ‘L’ may mean ‘low.’ Either represents a 
result outside the reference range/value.
16.	Reference is the list of expected results in a “normal” urine.
17.	This is the list of visual aspects evaluated and chemical tests 
performed using a test strip.
18.	This microscopic evaluation of the urine is often only 
performed “if indicated” – when there are ab-normal findings 
on the visual and chemical examination. The results will list 
anything that is seen under the microscope.  It is quantified by 
number (so many per high power field (hpf)), or by a scale (such 
as 1+, 2+, 3+).  This may include cells, crystals, bacteria, etc.
19.	A comment to the doctor/person reading the report that the 
abnormal results noted should be con-sidered in the context of 
the person’s clinical condition.  For instance bacteria and white 
blood cells (WBC)s may indicate an infection; but bacteria 
along with a significant number of epithelial cells could indicate 
an improper sample collection.
20.	The urinalysis results shown indicate that the person likely has 
an infection. For this reason, and because of the “Do C&S if 
indicated:  YES” comment under QUERIES, a culture will be 
automatically performed unless the doctor requests that the 
test not be performed.
