EXAMPLE ONLY
1.	 Name and address of the lab where the test was performed. 
Tests may be run in a physician office lab, a lab located in a 
clinic or hospital, and/or samples may be sent to a reference 
laboratory for analysis.
2.	 Date this copy of the report was printed. This date may be 
different than the date the results were generated, especially 
on cumulative reports (those that include results of several 
different tests run on different days).
3.	 Patient name or identifier. Links results to the correct person.
4.	 Patient identifier and identification number. Links results to 
the correct person.
5.	 Name of doctor. The lab will send the results to the doctor(s) 
or other healthcare practitioners listed.
6.	 Status of the test request, such as Routine or STAT (perform 
test as rapidly as possible).
7.	 Unique identification number(s). Number(s) assigned to the 
sample(s) when it arrives at the laboratory.
8.	 Test requested is a CBC and WBC differential. 
9.	 Information about the person and blood sample. Any 
pertinent information regarding the patient’s test preparation 
or the condition of specimen may be noted here.
10.	The date and time of sample collection
11.	The date and time that the laboratory received the sample.
12.	A listing of the individual items that are being evaluated. 
Test names may be abbreviated on lab reports. You can look 
for these test names or abbreviations in the pull-down menu 
on the home page of this site or type the name into the 
search box to find information on specific tests.
13.	A listing of the CBC and differential results that are normal.
14.	A listing of the CBC and differential results that are abnormal.
15.	An ‘H’ in this column may mean that the result is higher than 
the reference range. ‘L’ may mean ‘low.’ Either represents a 
result outside the reference range/value.
16.	Units of measurement (for quantitative results). The units of 
measurement that labs use to report your results can vary 
from lab to lab. Regardless of the units that the lab uses, your 
results will be interpreted in relation to the reference ranges 
supplied by the laboratory.
17.	Reference intervals (or reference ranges). These are the 
ranges in which “normal” values are expected to fall. The 
ranges that appear on your report are validated and supplied 
by the laboratory that performed your test. 
18.	Critical results are dangerously abnormal results that must be 
reported immediately to the responsible person, such as the 
ordering physician. The laboratory will often draw attention 
to such results with an asterisk (*) or something similar 
and will usually note on the report the date and time the 
responsible person was notified.
